## A forum website made in Django
The website uses every core Django functionality and has been built for learning purposes.
The main functionalities include:
  - Creating, logging, deleting and updating user(and user's profile)
  - Creating, updating and deleting posts(threads)
  - Handling users in a secure way
  - Password reset mechanism
  - Static content delivery

and a lot more.
This project is made for learning purposes so feel free to use it however you want.

This project is using HTML and CSS template made by [Sadhana Ganapathiraju](http://nikhedonia.com). The original template has been changed by me to fit the project better.
